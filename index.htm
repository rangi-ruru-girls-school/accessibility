            <h2>Why it matters</h2>
            <p>Designing for inclusivity not only opens up our products and experiences to more people with a wider
                range of abilities. It also reflects how people really are. All humans are growing, changing, and
                adapting to the world around them every day. We want our designs to reflect that diversity.</p>
            <p>Every decision we make can raise or lower barriers to participation in society. It’s our collective
                responsibility to lower these barriers.</p>
            <p><em>Sometimes exclusion is temporary.</em> Even a short-term injury or context affects the way people
                interact with the world around them, if only for a short time. Think about looking into a bright light,
                wearing a cast, or ordering dinner in a foreign country.</p>
            <p><em>Sometimes exclusion is situational.</em> As people move through different environments, their
                abilities can
                also change dramatically. In a loud crowd, they can’t hear well. In a car, they’re visually impaired.
                New parents spend much of their day doing tasks one-handed.</p>
            <p><em>Solve for one, extend to many.</em> We aim to build experiences that unify people and embrace
                individuality. Seeing disability differently and understanding exclusion helps us extend a solution for
                one person into a solution for millions of people.</p>

            <h2>Semantic HTML</h2>
            <p>Semantic elements are elements with a meaning. A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both
                the browser and the developer. Make your HTML code as semantic as possible, so that the code is easy to
                understand for visitors and screen readers.</p>
            <p>Examples of non-semantic elements: <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> - Tells nothing
                about its content.</p>
            <p>Examples of semantic elements: <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, and
                <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> - Clearly defines its content.</p>
            <p>Some things you can do to make your HTML more semantic:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Headings: search engines use headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.</li>
                <li>Alternative text: the <code>alt</code> attribute provides text for an image incase it's broken or
                    the user can't view it (because of slow connection, an error in the <code>src</code> attribute, or
                    if the user uses a screen reader.</li>
                <li>Language: screen readers and search engines both use the <code>lang</code> attribute to know the
                    language the page is in.</li>
                <li>Link title: giving your links a <code>title</code> attribute helps by showing a tooltip when the
                    user hovers over the link.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Colours</h2>
            <p>Colour blindness affects 1 in 12 men (8%) and 1 in 200 women (0.5%). The most common type is red/green
                colour blindness which makes it difficult for people to see the difference between red and green.</p>
            <p>Sites like <a href="https://coolors.co" title="Coolors color palette generator.">Coolors.co</a> and <a
                    href="https://color.adobe.com/" title="Adobe color palette generator.">Adobe Color</a> usually take
                into account colour blindness when they generate a colour palette. In Coolors, you can choose specific
                types of colour blindness to generate palettes for.</p>
            <p>Some things you can do to make your HTML more semantic:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Avoid red and green elements near one another.</li>
                <li>Avoid red text on a green background, and vice versa.</li>
